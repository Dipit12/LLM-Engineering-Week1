      "Why do we Need Arrays?Assume there is a class of five students and if we have to keep records of their marks in examination then, we can do this by declaring five variables individual and keeping track of records but what if the number of students becomes very large, it would be challenging to manipulate and maintain the data. So we use an array of students.Types of ArraysArrays can be classified in two ways:On the basis of SizeOn the basis of Dimensions Types of Arrays on the basis of  Size1. Fixed Sized ArraysWe cannot alter or update the size of this array.  Here only a fixed size (i,e. the size that is mentioned in square brackets []) of memory will be allocated for storage. In case, we don't know the size of the array then if we declare a larger size and store a lesser number of elements, it will result in a wastage of memory. And if we declare a lesser size than the number of elements then we won't get enough memory to store all the elements.\n",

      "Types of Arrays on the basis of Dimensions1. One-dimensional Array(1-D Array): You can imagine a 1d array as a row, where elements are stored one after another.2. Multi-dimensional Array: A multi-dimensional array is an array with more than one dimension. We can use multidimensional array to store complex data in the form of tables, etc. We can have 2-D arrays, 3-D arrays, 4-D arrays and so on. Two-Dimensional Array(2-D Array or Matrix): 2-D Multidimensional arrays can be considered as an array of arrays or as a matrix consisting of rows and columns.To read more about Matrix Refer, Matrix Data StructureThree-Dimensional Array(3-D Array): A 3-D Multidimensional array contains three dimensions, so it can be considered an array of two-dimensional arrays.Operations on ArrayTraversal in Array Insertions  :  At Beginning, At given position and At the end.
